#' @title rafikisol: A package to implement complex algorithms with Google Earth Engine
#' @author Trevan Flynn
#' @description
#' rafikisol is a package to implement strategies from literature with the resources
#' GEE has to offer such as parallel processing. In addition, it computes on GEEs
#' server so less computational power is needed for ones own computer. These models
#' are highly reproduceable and fairly quick for large areas. There are also some
#' algorithms not found on GEE such as soil depth functions and others. If the
#' algorithm is not our own it should be referenced from the original however,
#' we do have many original algorithms from our own literature.
#'
#' This package relies heavily on the rgee package.
