\title{Calculate a confusion index (CI)}
\usage{
ciCalc(probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{probs}{Is the output from the probCalc() function.}
}
\value{
An image of the confusion index.
}
\description{
Calculates the spatial CI from a bootstrapped ee model from Burrough et al. (1997)
where CI = 1 - (Pm - pm-1).Pm is the highest probability where Pm-1 is the second highest probability.
The final CI is the median of both Images. This function calculates the median values.
