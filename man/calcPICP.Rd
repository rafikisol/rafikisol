\title{Prediction interval coverage probability}
\usage{
calcPICP(models, eval, label)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{The results from regScale() or regBoot().}

\item{eval}{Validation data in as a Feature.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with a plot of PICP to confidence intervals, the results and
Lins concordance coefficient (how well the plot is in a 1:1 line).
}
\description{
A function to calculate the PICP of bootstrap ee models. It is meant to evaluate
uncertainties of the predictions. It is basically a complete replica of the code
by Malone et al., (2011), we just do most of the calculations on images first.
